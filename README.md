This is a proxy-based YouTube downloader with a graphical user interface. It allows users to download YouTube videos and audio files with ease. To make it work, you need to have certain dependencies in place, such as the FFmpeg suite and a designated folder for storing downloaded media.

## Features

- Graphical interface for ease of use.
- Supports multiple formats and resolutions (depending on the FFmpeg configuration).

1. `ffmpeg.exe`
2. `ffplay.exe`
3. `ffprobe.exe`
4. Folder named `youtube_downloads` where all videos and audio files will be saved.

You can download the FFmpeg suite from [FFmpeg Official Website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

## Installation
1. Download YouTube Downloader.exe
2. Place the FFmpeg binaries (`ffmpeg.exe`, `ffplay.exe`, and `ffprobe.exe`) in the same folder as the script.
3. Create a folder named `youtube_downloads` in the same directory.

## Usage
1. Run the script to launch the GUI.
2. Enter the YouTube video URL.
3. Select the desired format and quality.
